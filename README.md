Welcome to the Matrix!


This project will (probably) be your first experience with an Unix terminal!

For this project, please start and connect to your Sandbox Ubuntu 20.04.

Do not use GitHub’s web UI, but the command line to perform the exercise (except for operations that can not possibly be done any other way than through the web UI). You won’t be able to perform many of the task requirements on the web UI, and you should start getting used to the command line for simple tasks because many complex tasks can only be done via the command line.
Your answer files should only contain the command, and nothing else

Tasks
### 0. Create and setup your Git and GitHub account
mandatory
Score: 100.0% (Checks completed: 100.0%)
Step 0 - Create an account on GitHub [if you do not have one already]
You will need a GitHub account for all your projects at ALX. If you do not already have a github.com account, you can create an account for free here

Step 1 - Create a Personal Access Token on Github
To have access to your repositories and authenticate yourself, you need to create a Personal Access Token on Github.

You can follow this tutorial to create a token.

Once it’s created, you should have a token that looks like this:



Step 2 - Update your profile on the Intranet
Update your Intranet profile by adding your Github username here

If it’s not done the Checker won’t be able to correct your work



Step 3 - Create your first repository
Using the graphic interface on the github website, create your first repository.

Name: alx-zero_day
Description: I'm now a ALX Student, this is my first repository as a full-stack engineer
Public repo
No README, .gitignore, or license


Step 4 - Open the sandbox
On the intranet, just under the task, click on the button  and run to start the machine.

Once the container is started, click on  to open a shell where you can start work from.

Step 5 - Clone your repository
On the webterm of the sandbox, do the following:

Clone your repository
root@896cf839cf9a:/# git clone https://{YOUR_PERSONAL_TOKEN}@github.com/{YOUR_USERNAME}/alx-zero_day.git                  
Cloning into 'alx-zero_day'...
warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.       
Replace {YOUR_PERSONAL_TOKEN} with your token from step 1

Replace {YOUR_USERNAME} with your username from step 0 and 1

Pro-Tip: On windows, use CTRL + A + V to paste in the web terminal

Step 6 - Create the README.md and push the modifications
Navigate to this new directory. Tips
root@896cf839cf9a:/# cd alx-zero_day/
root@896cf839cf9a:/alx-zero_day#
Create the file README.md with the content My first readme. Tips

Good job!

You pushed your first file in your first repository of the first task of your first ALX School project.

You can now check your repository on GitHub to see if everything is good.

Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-zero_day
File: README.md
   
### 1. Repo-session
mandatory
Score: 100.0% (Checks completed: 100.0%)
Create a new directory called 0x03-git in your alx-zero_day repo.

Make sure you include a not empty README.md in your directory:

at the root of your repository alx-zero_day
AND in the directory 0x03-git
And important part: Make sure your commit and push your code to Github - otherwise the Checker will always fail.

Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-zero_day
   
### 2. Coding fury road
mandatory
Score: 100.0% (Checks completed: 100.0%)
For the moment we have an empty project directory containing only a README.md. It’s time to code!

Create these directories at the root of your project: bash, c, js
Create these empty files:
c/c_is_fun.c
js/main.js
js/index.js
Create a file bash/alx with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "ALX"
Create a file bash/school with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "School"
Add all these new files to git
Commit your changes (message: “Starting to code today, so cool”) and push to the remote server
Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-zero_day
Directory: 0x03-git
File: bash/alx, bash/school, c/c_is_fun.c, js/main.js, js/index.js
   
### 3. Collaboration is the base of a company
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
A branch is like a copy of your project. It’s used mainly for:

adding a feature in development
collaborating on the same project with other developers
not breaking your entire repository
not upsetting your co-workers
The purpose of a branch is to isolate your work from the main code base of your project and/or from your co-workers’ work.

For this project, create a branch update_script and in this branch:

Create an empty file named bash/98
Update bash/alx by replacing echo "ALX" with echo "ALX School"
Update bash/school by replacing echo "School" with echo "The school is open!"
Add and commit these changes (message: “My personal work”)
Push this new branch Tips
Perfect! You did an amazing update in your project and it’s isolated correctly from the main branch.

Ho wait, your manager needs a quick fix in your project and it needs to be deployed now:

Change branch to main
Update the file bash/alx by replacing echo "ALX" with echo "ALX School is so cool!"
Delete the directory js
Commit your changes (message: “Hot fix”) and push to the origin
Ouf, hot fix is done!

Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-zero_day
Directory: 0x03-git
File: bash/alx, bash/school, bash/98
    
### 4. Collaboration: be up to date
mandatory
Score: 100.0% (Checks completed: 100.0%)
Of course, you can also work on the same branch as your co-workers and it’s best if you keep up to date with their changes.

For this task – and only for this task – please update your file README.md in the main branch from GitHub.com. It’s the only time you are allowed to update and commit from GitHub interface.

After you have done that, in your terminal:

Get all changes of the main branch locally (i.e. your README.md file will be updated)
Create a new file up_to_date at the root of your directory and in it, write the git command line used
Add up_to_date to git, commit (message: “How to be up to date in git”), and push to the origin
Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-zero_day
Directory: 0x03-git
File: README.md, up_to_date
   
### 5. HAAA what did you do???
#advanced
Score: 100.0% (Checks completed: 100.0%)
Collaboration is cool, but not really when you update the same file at the same time…

To illustrate that, please merge the branch update_script to main: “Cool, all my changes will be now part of the main branch, ready to be deployed!”

HHHHHHHAAAAAAAA

CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in bash/alx
As you can see, you have conflicts between two branches on the same file.

Your goal now is to resolve conflicts by using the version of the branch update_script, and push the result to the origin.

At the end, you should have all your work from the branch update_script (new file and two updated files) and all latest main commits (new files, delete folder, etc.), without conflicts.

Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-zero_day
Directory: 0x03-git
   
### 6. Never push too much
#advanced
Score: 100.0% (Checks completed: 100.0%)
Create a .gitignore file and define a rule to never push ~ files (generated by Emacs). Tips

Repo:
